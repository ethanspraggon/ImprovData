Analyzing attendance data for improv shows to gather insights about audience attendance. We'll examine features that might affect whether a audience member will attend a show. Were they recommended by someone else? Are they a repeat viewer? Is the weather bad? Are they there to see someone in particular?, or see a particular show?

We'll store our data on an sql server. This repo will have code for downloading data and code that analyzse this code. In the future, a web app can display the analytics based on a particular day.
